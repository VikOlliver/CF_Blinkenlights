# CF_Blinkenlights
LED Blinkenlight CF/EC meter code for Arduinos

This code uses an Arduino to measure a voltage difference accross the analogue ports using A/C. This allows
the conductivity of a salt solution to be measured without electrolysing the liquid under test.

Measurements can be read out via the Arduino USB prot or used to light up a configurable line of LEDs.

The LEDs are strobed one at a time, allowing a single current limiting resistor to be used.
